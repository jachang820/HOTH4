# Project:LNX

Originally developed for Hack on the Hill 4 at UCLA, Project:LNX is an app that connects people of different majors who want to work on interdisciplinary projects. While apps like this exist, they don't recognize the importance and possibilities in solving problems involving multiple fields. Our idea is aimed specifically toward students with diverse interests and new ideas that are not encapsulated by the arbitrary boundaries of mobile app clones. While programmers work together often, what is rarer and even more necessary is for programmers to work with chemists, chemists to work with linguists, and so on. And so this platform allows the linking of projects.

## Getting Started

2. Download latest version of Django with the command 'pip install django'
